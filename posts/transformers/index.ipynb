    "Transformers are the most popular NLP model architecture, and have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on a variety of NLP tasks. Transformers were introduced in the paper [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) and have since become the standard for NLP tasks. I have been interested in learning more about transformers and how they work, so I decided to implement a transformer model from scratch. In this notebook, I will walk through the process of implementing a transformer model for the task of text generation. This notebook is inspired by Andrej Karpathy's [Let's build GPT video](https://youtu.be/kCc8FmEb1nY?si=Mlny-iCYoyFojS3P). "

    "## Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "The text we have is in the form of a string, but we need to convert them to numbers so that we can feed them into our model. This process is called tokenization. To tokenize a text we split a text to its smallest meaningful units, which are called tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different ways to tokenize text, the simplest form being splitting the text into individual letters known as character-level tokenization. This has a very small vocabulary size (number of unique tokens), for example if we are tokenizing lower case english text, the vocabulary size would be 26 (26 letters in the alphabet). However, this is not very useful for our purposes, as we want to capture the meaning of the text. Since we are starting with letters the model has to learn the meaning of words from scratch, which is not very efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way would be to tokenize the text into words, which is known as word-level tokenization. This has a much larger vocabulary size, since english language has a lot of unique words. Dropping least frequent words from the vocabulary and replacing them with a special token like [UNK] is one way to reduce the vocabulary size. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sub-word tokenization is a middle ground between character-level and word-level tokenization. In sub-word tokenization, we split the text into sub-words, which are smaller than words but larger than characters. This allows us to capture the meaning of words while keeping the vocabulary size manageable. Most of the popular transformer models use sub-word tokenization. In this notebook, we will use the Wordpiece tokenizer from the [HuggingFace tokenizers library](https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/index) for the sake of simplicity"

The embedding layer is a trainable layer, which means that the embedding vectors are learned during training. Each token is represented by a vector of size $d_{model}$. The embedding layer is implemented in pytorch as nn.Embedding, it is like a lookup table which maps the token ids to embedding vectors. After converting the tokens to embedding vectors, we add the positional encodings to the embedding vectors. The positional encodings are added to the embedding vectors to give the model information about the position of the tokens in the sequence. In the paper, they use sine and cosine functions to generate the positional encodings given by the following equations:\n",

    "## Multi-Head Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous NLP architectures like RNNs had only one hidden state, which had to encode all the information about the input sequence. This made it difficult for the model to learn long range dependencies. The attention mechanism solves this problem by allowing the model to focus on the relevant parts of the input sequence. The attention mechanism is a weighted sum of the values, where the weights are calculated by taking the dot product of the query and the key vectors. The query, key and value vectors are obtained by multiplying the input with three different weight matrices. The formula for attention is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}})V$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Q$ is the query matrix, $K$ is the key matrix, $V$ is the value matrix and $d_k$ is the dimension of the key matrix. Intuitively, we can assume the query matrix as the list items we wish to purchase in a store, the key matrix as the list of items in the store and the value as the actual items we purchase. When we take a dot product of the query and key matrix, we get a score for each item in the store. The higher the score the more relevant the items is to our query. The softmax function is applied to the scores to get a probability distribution over the items in the store. The value matrix is multiplied with the probability distribution to get the quantity of each items we wish to purchase. \n",
    "\n",
    "There maybe more than one attention mechanism in a transformer model, each of which is called a head. The multi-head attention mechanism is a concatenation of multiple attention heads. The decoder uses masked multi-head attention, which is similar to multi-head attention except that the attention weights are masked so that the model cannot attend to future tokens i.e when predicting the next token, the model can only attend to the tokens that have already been predicted. The masked multi-head attention can be implemented by this cool trick explained by Andrej Karpathy in his video.\n",
